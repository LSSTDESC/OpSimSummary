`OpSimSummary` is a codebase developed to interact with the LSST Operations Simulator outputs. Currently they are used for catalog Time Domain Simulations. 
This includes a library that can be called by simulation codes to obtain the set of LSST pointings observing a particular point, as well as a script which uses
the library and precomputes such pointings and store them in an observation library. This storage is in a format specific to [`SNANA`](http://snana.uchicago.edu/)

# Using `OpSimSummary`
`OpSimSumamry` is open source and licensed under [BSD 3-clause](./LICENSE). While a release is available at [zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/2671955#.XNPhvi2ZM1g) the software will continue to be developed as needed in this github repository. If you plan to use a released version on zenodo, you can cite the specific release (for example the current release using the doi (for example see the `Export` section of the [zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/2671955#.XNPhvi2ZM1g) page for the release.) Alternatively, you can cite the a specific non-release version on the github repository through the git SHA.

Additionally, in both cases, please cite the [code paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02887). If you are using bibtex, [NASA ADS](http://adsabs.harvard.edu) provides a [bibtex](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019arXiv190502887B/exportcitation)  for this reference (as also other formatted forms).

- Documentation is hosted at [github_pages](https://lsstdesc.github.io/OpSimSummary/build/html/index.html). The overview section has snippets for the use as an API as well as documentation of the script needed to create SNANA simlib files. (This is described in greater detail in the a [demo notebook](./example/Demo_make_simlibs.ipynb))

## Installation  and Software Requirements

`opsimsummary` runs on python 3.6+ . The list of required software to run `opsimsummary` is listed [here](./install/requirements.md). For installation methods, please see the [documentation](https://lsstdesc.github.io/OpSimSummary/build/html/installation.html)
